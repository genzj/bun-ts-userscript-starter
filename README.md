# bun-ts-userscript-starter

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.27. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To build:

```bash
bun run build  # minified dist
bun run build:dev  # development mode without minification and with inline sourcemap
```

## TBD

- [ ] better README
- [x] watch and autoreload for development
- [x] serve the generated userscript during watching
- [ ] support serving with proper filename, update url and download url
